	<p> My name is Cristhian Antonio. As a senior at Bronx Early College Academy, I gained insightful exposure to web development. Currently I am a barista at Starbucks but in the previous years, I held many positions that gave me insight into the food industry. Although that is not a path I see for myself in the future, I like to see where life takes me! </p>

	 <p> My father is my biggest motivator. Not only does he push me to be better, seeing him work hard only inspires me to reach for the stars </p>
