<p style= "color:white;"> Mmmh, mmmh, Yeah (doo, doo, dooo, doo)
<br>Gotta change my answering machine
<br>Now that I'm alone
<br>'Cause right now, it says that we
<br>Can't come to the phone
<br>And I know it makes no sense
<br>'Cause you walked out the door
<br>But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
<br>It's ridiculous
<br>It's been months
<br>And for some reason I just
<br>Can't get over us
<br>And I'm stronger than this, yeah
<br>Enough is enough
<br>No more walkin' round
<br>With my head down
<br>I'm so over being blue
<br>Cryin' over you
<br>And I'm so sick of love songs
<br>So tired of tears
<br>So done with wishing
<br>You were still here
<br>Said, I'm so sick of love songs
<br>So sad and slow
<br>So why can't I turn off the radio?
<br>Gotta fix that calendar I have
<br>That's marked July 15th
<br>Because since there's no more you
<br>There's no more anniversary
<br>I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
<br>And your memory
<br>And how every song reminds me
<br>Of what used to be
<br>That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
<br>So tired of tears
<br>So done with wishing
<br>She was still here
<br>Said, I'm so sick of love songs
<br>So sad and slow
<br>Why can't I turn off the radio?
<br>Why can't I turn off the radio?
<br>Why can't I turn off the radio? </p>
